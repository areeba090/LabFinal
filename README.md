# Smart Home Energy Saving: Lighting Control
This project demonstrates a Smart Home Energy Saving system focused on the Lighting Control use case. The system automates turning lights on or off based on ambient light levels detected by a sensor. The implementation follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and enhancing modularity and maintainability.
**
# Project Overview**
Use Case
# Lighting Control : 
Automatically controls lights to optimize energy consumption based on detected light levels, contributing to a smarter and more energy-efficient home environment.
# Objective
Save energy by turning off lights when sufficient natural light is available.
Turn on lights when ambient light levels are low.
# Architecture
The system is designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

# Model:
Encapsulates the system's data and functionality (e.g., light sensor, lighting system, and individual lights).
# View: 
Displays the system's state and output to the user (e.g., automation status, light state).
# Controller:
Serves as the mediator, handling logic, processing sensor data, and coordinating between the Model and the View.
the system's status and decisions.
